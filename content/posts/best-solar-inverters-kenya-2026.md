## 1. Must PH1800 3kW 24V (The "Starter" King)
The **Must Inverter** has become a household name in Kenya. If you go to any solar shop in River Road or Luthuli Avenue, this is likely the first one they will show you.

### Performance in Kenya
The 3kW Must is perfect for a typical 2-bedroom apartment. It can comfortably run your TV, Fridge (Energy Efficient), WiFi, and all your LED lights.

* **Why we like it:** It is extremely "rugged." It handles the voltage fluctuations of the Kenyan grid surprisingly well for its price point.
* **The Downside:** The charging algorithm for Lithium batteries isn't as advanced as Deye. If you plan to buy a high-end Lithium battery later, you might outgrow this inverter quickly.

---

## 2. Growatt SPF 5000ES (The Fan Favorite)
The Growatt 5kW is the "Toyota" of the solar world in Kenya—reliable, parts are everywhere, and every technician knows how to install it.

### Why it's trending in 2026
With the 2026 upgrades, the Growatt now features better WiFi monitoring. You can check how much power your panels are producing while you are at work in Upper Hill or Westlands using the ShinePhone App.

* **Key Feature:** It is a "Transformerless" inverter, making it lighter and more efficient than older models.
* **Price Note:** Expect to pay slightly more for the WiFi dongle, but it is worth it for the peace of mind.

## 3. Deye 5kW Hybrid (The Lithium Specialist)
If you have invested in a **Felicity or Pylontech Lithium battery**, do not settle for a cheap inverter. The Deye 5kW is widely considered the best hybrid inverter in the Kenyan market for 2026.

### Advanced Features
Deye allows for "Time of Use" settings. You can program it to use KPLC power during the cheap off-peak hours (if available) and switch to battery during peak times. This is the secret to cutting your bill by 70%.

## 🛡️ How to Avoid "Fake" Inverters in Nairobi
One of the biggest reasons for a high **bounce rate** on solar systems is equipment failure. Before you buy, check for:
1.  **The Weight:** High-quality inverters have heavy copper components. If it feels like a plastic toy, avoid it.
2.  **The Warranty:** Only buy from dealers offering at least a 1-year local warranty.
3.  **Serial Numbers:** Genuine Must and Growatt inverters have serial numbers you can verify on their official websites.

## 💡 Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### Can a 3kW Inverter run a Microwave?
Technically yes, but we don't recommend it for long. A microwave draws about 1200W-1500W. On a 3kW system, this is 50% of your capacity. If your fridge kicks in at the same time, the inverter might trip.

### Which battery is best for these inverters?
In 2026, **LiFePO4 (Lithium)** is the way to go. While Tubular batteries are cheaper upfront, Lithium lasts 10 years, whereas Tubular often fails after 2 years in Kenyan heat.
