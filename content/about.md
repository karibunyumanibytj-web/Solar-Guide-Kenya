# Switching to Solar Shouldn't Be Confusing ☀️

At **Solar Guide Kenya**, we help you navigate the complex world of renewable energy. Whether you are in Nairobi looking to cut down a 10,000 KES monthly power bill or in a rural area seeking reliable off-grid power, we’ve got you covered.

### Why You Can Trust Us
The Kenyan solar market is flooded with low-quality clones. We started this guide because we saw too many households investing in batteries that die in six months. 

We bridge the gap by providing:
* **Vetted Reviews:** We analyze brands like **Must, Growatt, and Victron** specifically for how they handle the Kenyan grid and climate.
* **Local Market Prices:** No "price on call." We track estimated costs in KES to help you budget accurately.
* **Installation Logic:** We don't just sell; we explain. From sizing your array to choosing between **Lithium-ion (LiFePO4)** and **Gel batteries**, we make the tech simple.

### How We Help You Save
1.  **The Budget Finder:** Reviews of affordable, high-performance Tier-1 panels.
2.  **Warranty Guides:** We prioritize products with local service centers in Kenya so you're never left in the dark.
3.  **Real Math:** We show you the actual ROI (Return on Investment) based on current **KPLC tariffs**.
