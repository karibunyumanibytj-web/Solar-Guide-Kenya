# Welcome to Solar Guide Kenya ☀️

At **Solar Guide Kenya**, we believe that clean, affordable energy should be accessible to every household and business in Kenya. 

### Why We Started
High electricity bills and frequent blackouts are a challenge for many. While there are many solar products in the market, finding **honest reviews** and **accurate prices** in Nairobi, Mombasa, and across the country is difficult. 

### What We Do
We provide expert guides on:
- **Solar Inverters:** Comparing Must, Growatt, and Victron for the Kenyan climate.
- **Battery Tech:** Helping you choose between Lithium-ion (LiFePO4) and Gel batteries.
- **Price Transparency:** Tracking current market prices at local dealers.

### Our Promise
We only recommend products that are durable and have local warranty support. Our goal is to save you money while keeping your lights on, 24/7.

**Karibu Nyumbani!**
